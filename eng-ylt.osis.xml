      <VERS vnumber="17">All the generations, therefore, from Abraham unto David <STYLE css="color:#808080;font-style:italic">are</STYLE> fourteen generations, and from David unto the Babylonian removal fourteen generations, and from the Babylonian removal unto the Christ, fourteen generations.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And of Jesus Christ, the birth was thus: For his mother Mary having been betrothed to Joseph, before their coming together she was found to have conceived from the Holy Spirit,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">and Joseph her husband being righteous, and not willing to make her an example, did wish privately to send her away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And on his thinking of these things, lo, a messenger of the Lord in a dream appeared to him, saying, 'Joseph, son of David, you may not fear to receive Mary your wife, for that which in her was conceived <STYLE css="color:#808080;font-style:italic">is</STYLE> of the Holy Spirit,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">and she shall bring forth a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he shall save his people from their sins.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And all this has come to pass, that it may be fulfilled that was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">'Lo, the virgin shall conceive, and she shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel,' which is, being interpreted 'With us <STYLE css="color:#808080;font-style:italic">he is</STYLE> God.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And Joseph, having risen from the sleep, did as the messenger of the Lord directed him, and received his wife,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">and did not know her till she brought forth her son -- the first-born, and he called his name Jesus.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And Jesus having been born in Beth-Lehem of Judea, in the days of Herod the king, lo, mages from the east came to Jerusalem,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">saying, 'Where is he who was born king of the Jews? For we saw his star in the east, and we came to bow to him.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And Herod the king having heard, was stirred, and all Jerusalem with him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">and having gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he was inquiring from them where the Christ is born.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And they said to him, 'In Beth-Lehem of Judea, for thus it has been written through the prophet,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And you, Beth-Lehem, the land of Judah, you are by no means the least among the leaders of Judah, for out of you shall come one leading, who shall feed My people Israel.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then Herod, privately having called the mages, did inquire exactly from them the time of the appearing star,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">and having sent them to Beth-Lehem, he said, 'Having gone -- inquire you exactly for the child, and whenever you may have found, bring me back word, that I also having come may bow to him.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And they, having heard the king, departed, and lo, the star, that they did see in the east, did go before them, till, having come, it stood over where the child was.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And having seen the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">and having come to the house, they found the child with Mary his mother, and having fallen down they bowed to him, and having opened their treasures, they presented to him gifts, gold, and frankincense, and myrrh,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">and having been divinely warned in a dream not to turn back unto Herod, through another way they withdrew to their own region.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And on their having withdrawn, lo, a messenger of the Lord does appear in a dream to Joseph, saying, 'Having risen, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and be you there till I may speak to you, for Herod is about to seek the child to destroy him.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And he, having risen, took the child and his mother by night, and withdrew to Egypt,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">and he was there till the death of Herod, that it might be fulfilled that was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, 'Out of Egypt I did call My Son.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then Herod, having seen that he was deceived by the mages, was very enraged, and having sent forth, he murdered all the male children in Beth-Lehem, and in all its borders, from two years and under, according to the time that he inquired exactly from the mages.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">'A voice in Ramah was heard -- lamentation and weeping and much mourning -- Rachel weeping <STYLE css="color:#808080;font-style:italic">for</STYLE> her children, and she would not be comforted because they are not.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And Herod having died, lo, a messenger of the Lord in a dream does appear to Joseph in Egypt,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">saying, 'Having risen, take the child and his mother, and be going to the land of Israel, for they have died -- those seeking the life of the child.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And he, having risen, took the child and his mother, and came to the land of Israel,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">and having heard that Archelaus does reign over Judea instead of Herod his father, he was afraid to go there, and having been divinely warned in a dream, he withdrew to the parts of Galilee,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">and coming, he dwelt in a city named Nazareth, that it might be fulfilled that was spoken through the prophets, that 'A Nazarene he shall be called.'</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And in those days comes John the Baptist, proclaiming in the wilderness of Judea,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">and saying, 'Reform, for come near has the reign of the heavens,'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">for this is he who was spoken of by Isaiah the prophet, saying, 'A voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare you the way of the Lord, straight make you His paths.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And this John had his clothing of camel's hair, and a girdle of skin round his loins, and his nourishment was locusts and honey of the field.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then were going forth unto him Jerusalem, and all Judea, and all the region round about the Jordan,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">and they were baptized in the Jordan by him, confessing their sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And having seen many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming about his baptism, he said to them, 'Brood of vipers! Who did show you to flee from the coming wrath?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Bear, therefore, fruits worthy of the reformation,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">and do not think to say in yourselves, A father we have -- Abraham, for I say to you, that God is able out of these stones to raise children to Abraham,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">and now also, the axe unto the root of the trees is laid, every tree therefore not bearing good fruit is hewn down, and to fire is cast.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">'I indeed do baptize you with water to reformation, but he who after me is coming is mightier than I, of whom I am not worthy to bear the sandals, he shall baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">whose fan <STYLE css="color:#808080;font-style:italic">is</STYLE> in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his floor, and will gather his wheat to the storehouse, but the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then comes Jesus from Galilee upon the Jordan, unto John to be baptized by him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">but John was forbidding him, saying, 'I have need by you to be baptized -- and you do come unto me!'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But Jesus answering said to him, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">'Permit now, for thus it is becoming to us to fulfill all righteousness,'</STYLE> then he does permit him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And having been baptized, Jesus went up immediately from the water, and lo, opened to him were the heavens, and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove, and coming upon him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">and lo, a voice out of the heavens, saying, 'This is My Son -- the Beloved, in whom I did delight.'</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then Jesus was led up to the wilderness by the Spirit, to be tempted by the Devil,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">and having fasted forty days and forty nights, afterwards he did hunger.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And the Tempter having come to him said, 'If Son you are of God -- speak that these stones may become loaves.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But he answering said, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">'It has been written, Not upon bread alone does man live, but upon every word coming forth from the mouth of God.'</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then does the Devil take him to the <STYLE css="color:#808080;font-style:italic">holy</STYLE> city, and does set him on the pinnacle of the temple,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">and said to him, 'If Son you are of God -- cast yourself down, for it has been written, that, His messengers He shall charge concerning you, and on hands they shall bear you up, that you may not dash on a stone your foot.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Jesus said to him again, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">'It has been written, You shall not tempt the Lord your God.'</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Again does the Devil take him to a very high mount, and does show to him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">and said to him, 'All these to you I will give, if falling down you may bow to me.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then said Jesus to him, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">'Go -- Adversary, for it has been written, The Lord your God you shall bow to, and Him only you shall serve.'</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then does the Devil leave him, and lo, messengers came and were ministering to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And Jesus having heard that John was delivered up, did withdraw to Galilee,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">and having left Nazareth, having come, he dwelt at Capernaum that is by the sea, in the borders of Zebulun and Naphtalim,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">that it might be fulfilled that was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">'Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali, way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations! --</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The people that is sitting in darkness saw a great light, and to those sitting in a region and shadow of death -- light arose to them.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">From that time began Jesus to proclaim and to say, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">'Reform you, for come near has the reign of the heavens.'</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brothers, Simon named Peter and Andrew his brother, casting a drag into the sea -- for they were fishers --</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">and he said to them, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">'Come you after me, and I will make you fishers of men,'</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">and they, immediately, having left the nets, did follow him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And having advanced from there, he saw other two brothers, James of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, refitting their nets, and he called them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">and they, immediately, having left the boat and their father, did follow him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And Jesus was going about all Galilee teaching in their synagogues, and proclaiming the good news of the reign, and healing every disease, and every malady among the people,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">and his fame went forth to all Syria, and they brought to him all having ailments, pressed with manifold sicknesses and pains, and demoniacs, and lunatics, and paralytics, and he healed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And there followed him many multitudes from Galilee, and Decapolis, and Jerusalem, and Judea, and beyond the Jordan.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And having seen the multitudes, he went up to the mount, and he having sat down, his disciples came to him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">and having opened his mouth, he was teaching them, saying:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">Annas and Caiaphas being chief priests -- there came a word of God unto John the son of Zacharias, in the wilderness,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">John answered, saying to all, 'I indeed with water do baptize you, but he comes who is mightier than I, of whom I am not worthy to loose the latchet of his sandals -- he shall baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">whose winnowing shovel <STYLE css="color:#808080;font-style:italic">is</STYLE> in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his floor, and will gather the wheat to his storehouse, and the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable.'</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="21">And it came to pass, in all the people being baptized, Jesus also being baptized, and praying, the heaven was opened,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="24">seeing we have heard that certain having gone forth from us did trouble you with words, subverting your souls, saying to be circumcised and to keep the law, to whom we did give no charge,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">And certain of them did believe, and attached themselves to Paul and to Silas, also of the worshipping Greeks a great multitude, of the principal women also not a few.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And the unbelieving Jews, having been moved with envy, and having taken to them of the loungers certain evil men, and having made a crowd, were setting the city in an uproar; having assailed also the house of Jason, they were seeking them to bring <STYLE css="color:#808080;font-style:italic">them</STYLE> to the populace,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="15">And those conducting Paul, brought him unto Athens, and having received a command unto Silas and Timotheus that with all speed they may come unto him, they departed;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">and Paul waiting for them in Athens, his spirit was stirred in him, beholding the city wholly given to idolatry,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="18">And certain of the Epicurean and of the Stoic philosophers, were meeting together to see him, and some were saying, 'What would this seed picker wish to say?' and others, 'Of strange demons he does seem to be an announcer;' because Jesus and the rising again he did proclaim to them as good news,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">having also taken him, unto the Areopagus they brought <STYLE css="color:#808080;font-style:italic">him</STYLE>, saying, 'Are we able to know what <STYLE css="color:#808080;font-style:italic">is</STYLE> this new teaching that is spoken by you,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="21">and all Athenians, and the strangers sojourning, for nothing else were at leisure but to say something, and to hear some newer thing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And Paul, having stood in the midst of the Areopagus, said, 'Men, Athenians, in all things I perceive you as over-religious;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">for passing through and contemplating your objects of worship, I found also an erection on which had been inscribed: To God -- unknown; whom, therefore -- not knowing -- you do worship, this One I announce to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">'God, who did make the world, and all things in it, this One, of heaven and of earth being Lord, in temples made with hands does not dwell,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="29">'Being, therefore, offspring of God, we ought not to think the Godhead to be like to gold, or silver, or stone, graving of art and device of man;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">the times, indeed, therefore, of the ignorance God having overlooked, does now command all men everywhere to reform,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="32">And having heard of a rising again of the dead, some, indeed, were mocking, but others said, 'We will hear you again concerning this;'</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">and he was reasoning in the synagogue every sabbath, persuading both Jews and Greeks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And when both Silas and Timotheus came down from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in the Spirit, testifying fully to the Jews Jesus the Christ;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">and on their resisting and speaking evil, having shaken <STYLE css="color:#808080;font-style:italic">his</STYLE> garments, he said unto them, 'Your blood <STYLE css="color:#808080;font-style:italic">is</STYLE> upon your head -- I am clean; henceforth to the nations I will go on.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And having departed thence, he went to the house of a certain one, by name Justus, a worshipper of God, whose house was adjoining the synagogue,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">and he having been called, Tertullus began to accuse <STYLE css="color:#808080;font-style:italic">him</STYLE>, saying, 'Much peace enjoying through you, and worthy deeds being done to this nation through your forethought,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">always, also, and everywhere we receive it, most noble Felix, with all thankfulness;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">and that I may not be further tedious to you, I pray you to hear us concisely in your gentleness;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">for having found this man a pestilence, and moving a dissension to all the Jews through the world -- a ringleader also of the sect of the Nazarenes --</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">who also the temple did try to profane, whom also we took, and according to our law did wish to judge,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">and Lysias the chief captain having come near, with much violence, out of our hands did take away,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">having commanded his accusers to come to you, from whom you may be able, yourself having examined, to know concerning all these things of which we accuse him;'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">and the Jews also agreed, professing these things to be so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And Paul answered -- the governor having beckoned to him to speak -- 'Knowing <STYLE css="color:#808080;font-style:italic">that</STYLE> for many years you hast been a judge to this nation, the more cheerfully the things concerning myself I do answer;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">you being able to know that it is not more than twelve days to me since I went up to worship in Jerusalem,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">'And I confess this to you, that, according to the way that they call a sect, so serve I the God of the fathers, believing all things that in the law and the prophets have been written,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">having hope toward God, which they themselves also wait for, <STYLE css="color:#808080;font-style:italic">that</STYLE> there is about to be a rising again of the dead, both of righteous and unrighteous;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">and in this I do exercise myself, to have a conscience void of offence toward God and men always.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">'And after many years I came, about to do kind acts to my nation, and offerings,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">in which certain Jews from Asia did find me purified in the temple, not with multitude, nor with tumult,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="20">or let these same say if they found any unrighteousness in me in my standing before the sanhedrin,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">except concerning this one voice, in which I cried, standing among them -- Concerning a rising again of the dead I am judged to-day by you.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And having heard these things, Felix delayed them -- having known more exactly of the things concerning the way -- saying, 'When Lysias the chief captain may come down, I will know fully the things concerning you;'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">having given also a direction to the centurion to keep Paul, to let <STYLE css="color:#808080;font-style:italic">him</STYLE> also have liberty, and to forbid none of his own friends to minister or to come near to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And after certain days, Felix having come with Drusilla his wife, being a Jewess, he sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith toward Christ,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">and he reasoning concerning righteousness, and temperance, and the judgment that is about to be, Felix, having become afraid, answered, 'For the present be going, and having got time, I will call for you;'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">and at the same time also hoping that money shall be given to him by Paul, that he may release him, therefore, also sending for him the oftener, he was conversing with him;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">and two years having been fulfilled, Felix received a successor, Porcius Festus; Felix also willing to lay a favour on the Jews, left Paul bound.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="25">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Festus, therefore, having come into the province, after three days went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">and the chief priest and the principal men of the Jews made manifest to him <STYLE css="color:#808080;font-style:italic">the things</STYLE> against Paul, and were calling on him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">asking favour against him, that he may send for him to Jerusalem, making an ambush to put him to death in the way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then, indeed, Festus answered that Paul is kept in Caesarea, and himself is about speedily to go on thither,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">'Therefore those able among you -- said he -- having come down together, if there be anything in this man -- let them accuse him;'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">and having tarried among them more than ten days, having gone down to Caesarea, on the morrow having sat upon the tribunal, he commanded Paul to be brought;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">and he having come, there stood round about the Jews who have come down from Jerusalem -- many and weighty charges they are bringing against Paul, which they were not able to prove,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">he making defence -- 'Neither in regard to the law of the Jews, nor in regard to the temple, nor in regard to Caesar -- did I commit any sin.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And Festus willing to lay on the Jews a favour, answering Paul, said, 'Art you willing, to Jerusalem having gone up, there concerning these things to be judged before me?'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">and Paul said, 'At the tribunal of Caesar I am standing, where it behooves me to be judged; to Jews I did no unrighteousness, as you do also very well know;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">for if indeed I am unrighteous, and anything worthy of death have done, I deprecate not to die; and if there is none of the things of which these accuse me, no one is able to make a favour of me to them; to Caesar I appeal!'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">then Festus, having communed with the council, answered, 'To Caesar you hast appealed; to Caesar you shall go.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And certain days having passed, Agrippa the king, and Bernice, came down to Caesarea saluting Festus,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">and as they were continuing there more days, Festus submitted to the king the things concerning Paul, saying, 'There is a certain man, left by Felix, a prisoner,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">about whom, in my being at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews laid information, asking a decision against him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">unto whom I answered, that it is not a custom of Romans to make a favour of any man to die, before that he who is accused may have the accusers face to face, and may receive place of defence in regard to the charge laid against <STYLE css="color:#808080;font-style:italic">him</STYLE>.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">'They, therefore, having come together -- I, making no delay, on the succeeding <STYLE css="color:#808080;font-style:italic">day</STYLE> having sat upon the tribunal, did command the man to be brought,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">concerning whom the accusers, having stood up, were bringing against <STYLE css="color:#808080;font-style:italic">him</STYLE> no accusation of the things I was thinking of,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">but certain questions concerning their own religion they had against him, and concerning a certain Jesus who was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">and I, doubting in regard to the question concerning this, said, If he would wish to go on to Jerusalem, and there to be judged concerning these things --</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">but Paul having appealed to be kept to the hearing of Sebastus, I did command him to be kept till I might send him unto Caesar.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And Agrippa said unto Festus, 'I was wishing also myself to hear the man;' and he said, 'To-morrow you shall hear him;'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">on the morrow, therefore -- on the coming of Agrippa and Bernice with much display, and they having entered into the audience chamber, with the chief captains also, and the principal men of the city, and Festus having ordered -- Paul was brought forth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And Festus said, 'King Agrippa, and all men who are present with us, you see this one, about whom all the multitude of the Jews did deal with me, both in Jerusalem and here, crying out, He ought not to live any longer;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">and I, having found him to have done nothing worthy of death, and he also himself having appealed to Sebastus, I decided to send him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">concerning whom I have no certain thing to write to <STYLE css="color:#808080;font-style:italic">my</STYLE> lord, therefore I brought him forth before you, and specially before you, king Agrippa, that the examination having been made, I may have something to write;</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="26">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And Agrippa said unto Paul, 'It is permitted to you to speak for yourself;' then Paul having stretched forth the hand, was making a defence:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">to which our twelve tribes, intently night and day serving, do hope to come, concerning which hope I am accused, king Agrippa, by the Jews;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">why is it judged incredible with you, if God does raise the dead?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">'I, indeed, therefore, thought with myself, that against the name of Jesus of Nazareth it behoved <STYLE css="color:#808080;font-style:italic">me</STYLE> many things to do,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And when our sailing to Italy was determined, they were delivering up both Paul and certain others, prisoners, to a centurion, by name Julius, of the band of Sebastus,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">on the next <STYLE css="color:#808080;font-style:italic">day</STYLE> also we touched at Sidon, and Julius, courteously treating Paul, did permit <STYLE css="color:#808080;font-style:italic">him</STYLE>, having gone on unto friends, to receive <STYLE css="color:#808080;font-style:italic">their</STYLE> care.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And thence, having set sail, we sailed under Cyprus, because of the winds being contrary,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">and there the centurion having found a ship of Alexandria, sailing to Italy, did put us into it,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">but the centurion to the pilot and to the ship owner gave credence more than to the things spoken by Paul;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">and the haven being incommodious to winter in, the more part gave counsel to sail thence also, if by any means they might be able, having attained to Phenice, <STYLE css="color:#808080;font-style:italic">there</STYLE> to winter, <STYLE css="color:#808080;font-style:italic">which is</STYLE> a haven of Crete, looking to the south-west and north-west,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">For not to messengers did He subject the coming world, concerning which we speak,</VERS>
